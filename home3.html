        <h1>A Guide to Local Food for the Frugal Foodie</h1>
        <h2>By S.Sciuk</h2>
        <p>
        Yes, being a foodie is fun and delicious, but it also means being accountable for your food choices. When deciding what to cook tonight, consider this list of healthy, sustainable, and mostly local options:</p>
<p>
Rainbow trout is farmed in an ecologically sustainable way making it a “BEST CHOICE” on the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Sustainable Seafood guide. One serving contains about 1680mg of Omega-3 fatty acids, and is an excellent source of protein, vitamin B12, and selenium. It tastes like a cross between a white-fish and salmon making it a delightfully mild choice, even for the fish haters. And it’s cheaper than salmon! SOLD!</p>
 <p> ORGANIC PASTURE RAISED MEAT </p>
<p>
Animals that are pasture raised graze for food and grow at their own pace. Plus, pastured meat is better for you! Organic pastured meat is not exposed to chemicals, antibiotics, or hormones commonly found in feedlot animals, and grass-fed beef has 2-6 x more omega-3 fatty acids than grain-fed beef. Organic pastured meat is a little more expensive, but the goal is to eat smaller portions of higher quality meat. Check out The Healthy Butcher in Toronto for a selection of pastured raised meats.

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the change of the season is when the body is most susceptible to an invading illness. The colds and flus that hit in fall and winter are viral in nature, which means antibiotics are of no help. In the fall, the rhinovirus causes 80% of all colds.

In researching this article, I asked a few lawyers for their best negotiation tips.
And this was my favourite: “Walk into the room, sweep all the papers off the table and flip the table over. Glare menacingly at the other side and leave.”
The next time you find yourself seated at the literal or proverbial table (or standing in the apartment of a stranger you met on the internet trying to buy his HEMNES shelving unit) here are some tips for walking away with an amazing deal.

You may not expect that a workshop on naturopathic approaches to detoxification would end with a “meat list”.
But ND-in-training Shayla Garland helped 30 participants prove otherwise at The LRMC Naturopathic Detox workshop.
A fourth year intern at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, Shayla’s talk included the basics of naturopathic health and detoxification, including treatment, prevention, and every day wellness. Shayla discussed simple ways to control your toxic intake including shopping The Dirty Dozen and The Green 15, and provided simple recipes for health and environmentally friendly cleansers and beauty products to detoxify your household.
