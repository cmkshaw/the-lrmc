        <h1>A Guide to Local Food for the Frugal Foodie</h1>
        <h2>By S.Sciuk</h2>
        <p> Yes, being a foodie is fun and delicious, but it also means being accountable for your food choices. When deciding what to cook tonight, consider this list of healthy, sustainable, and mostly local options:</p>
        <p> Rainbow trout is farmed in an ecologically sustainable way making it a “BEST CHOICE” on the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Sustainable Seafood guide. One serving contains about 1680mg of Omega-3 fatty acids, and is an excellent source of protein, vitamin B12, and selenium. It tastes like a cross between a white-fish and salmon making it a delightfully mild choice, even for the fish haters. And it’s cheaper than salmon! SOLD!</p>
        <p> ORGANIC PASTURE RAISED MEAT </p>
        <p> Animals that are pasture raised graze for food and grow at their own pace. Plus, pastured meat is better for you! Organic pastured meat is not exposed to chemicals, antibiotics, or hormones commonly found in feedlot animals, and grass-fed beef has 2-6 x more omega-3 fatty acids than grain-fed beef. Organic pastured meat is a little more expensive, but the goal is to eat smaller portions of higher quality meat. Check out The Healthy Butcher in Toronto for a selection of pastured raised meats. </p>
        <p id="two"> PASTURED EGGS </p>
        <p id="two"> Like all organic pasture raised animals, these chickens are able to run around, eat grass, and be in the sun. Pastured eggs contain 200% more omega 3 fatty acids, up to 600% more vitamin D, 66% more vitamin A, 300% more vitamin E , and 700% more beta carotene than regular eggs. Don’t be confused by eco-marketing terms like “cage-free” and “free-range”, these are not the same as pastured. For now, it’s unlikely that you’ll find pastured eggs at the supermarket, so where can you get your hands on some healthy, happy eggs? Visit the Healthy Butcher or join a Community Supported Agriculture group near you (see below). For more information check out this short video.
          Local IN-SEASON vegetables:</p>
        <p id="two"> Summer is the best time of the year for local Ontario produce. Almost all local vegetables are in season at some point between June and September. Not only do vegetables taste better in-season, they are usually cheaper too! So get out to the farmers market and load up on delicious veggies! Curious about the seasonality of veggies, check out Mama Earth to find the best time to purchase your favourite fruit or veggie.
          Feel free to share your favourite mouth-watering recipes below. In the words of my favourite adorable 4-year-old: Bon Appetit, you may eat! </p>

        <h2>June 11th, 2012</h2>
        <h1>Social Banking</h1>
        <h2>By Shannon Simmons</h2>
        <p> For every $1000 you deposit into a bank, likely 10% of your deposit must be held at the bank at all times.</p>
        <p> This is called the “reserve” and every bank has to have one. Most reserve rates tend to be 10% of all deposits, although there are different rates for different types of banks. For the purposes of this post, we will stick with 10% reserve rate.
        <p> The bank keeps 10% onsite in reserve and uses the other 90% to make money. It makes money by investing and lending out deposits. The banks don’t make money solely on your bank fees.
          
          So, in this scenario, if you deposited $1000 at the bank, $100 is held in reserve and $900 is loaned out to make the bank some money. </p>
        <p> The Big 5 Banks will invest or lend your $900 to companies they see as profitable. Here’s the thing: these can include large corporations like Canadian Oil Sands, Mining Companies, large conglomerates, etc. Basically, the bank does not take your values into account when lending or investing your money. If you want to ensure that your deposits are being put to more socially inclined local companies, there’s something you can do about it! </p>
        <p id="three"> Bank at a Credit Union. </p>
        <p id="three"> Credit unions have a specific mandate to support local companies and projects only. Each credit union is different, so you will need to do your homework to see what their mandate is. </p>
        <p id="three"> Credit unions work the same way as a bank, they have a reserve ratio as well. If we assume a reserve ratio of 10% on your $1000 deposit that means your $900 is now being used to invest in and loan money to local people and local companies that are generally social in their nature. </p>
        <p id="three"> Pros: </p>
        <p id="three"> Acculink: A network of ATMs that major credit unions use to allow members to use any ATM of any credit union. For example, if you banked at Alterna, you can use Alterna ATMs, national bank, and Desjardins without fees.
          Like a bank, your deposits are protected up to $100,000 Deposit Insurance Corporation of Ontario.
          Banking plan fees are similar to banks.
        <p id="three"> Similar branch services: </p>
        <p id="three"> Credit Cards.
          TFSA.
          RRSP.
          Investments:
          Access to socially responsible mutual funds.
          No minimum investment – any amount is possible </p>
        <p id="three"> Cons </p>
        <p id="three"> Fewer branches, even with Acculink. Watch for some of the ad-hoc fees of using other types of ATMs.
          They’re a little slow on updating technology. For example, there are no smart phone apps yet. </p>

        <p class="parchive"> In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the change of the season is when the body is most susceptible to an invading illness. The colds and flus that hit in fall and winter are viral in nature, which means antibiotics are of no help. In the fall, the rhinovirus causes 80% of all colds. </p>

        <figure class="archive_figure"> <img src="images/legal.jpg" alt="healthnut"> </figure>
        <p class="parchive"> In researching this article, I asked a few lawyers for their best negotiation tips.
          And this was my favourite: “Walk into the room, sweep all the papers off the table and flip the table over. Glare menacingly at the other side and leave.”
          The next time you find yourself seated at the literal or proverbial table (or standing in the apartment of a stranger you met on the internet trying to buy his HEMNES shelving unit) here are some tips for walking away with an amazing deal. </p>

        <p class="parchive"> You may not expect that a workshop on naturopathic approaches to detoxification would end with a “meat list”.
          But ND-in-training Shayla Garland helped 30 participants prove otherwise at The LRMC Naturopathic Detox workshop.
          A fourth year intern at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine, Shayla’s talk included the basics of naturopathic health and detoxification, including treatment, prevention, and every day wellness. </p>
